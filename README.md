I happy to bring you a currently (And has been) private tool I made a while back. This is a 100% External (And Undetectable) set of tools made for everything related to fishing in Terraria. Never have I seen any auto fishers for the game and I'm sure there will be nothing as remote as this tool is. In this Tool I combined all possible fishing bots I made for the game. Auto Bait Collector Bot, Auto Fishing Bot Remastered, And Unlimited Lines Utilizer Bot.
</p><p align="center">
Terraria has no VAC what so ever, however, for shits and giggles I made it safe from Tshock Plugins, Tmodloaders, Other Client > Client Scripts, and hypothetical future VAC. There are absolutely no addresses being read or written to on the game process. This bot simply leeches onto your sound drivers (After it came from the game) and listens for any sound coming from the javaw.exe process rail. All commands are sent via sendkeys (Like a macro) so once again nothing is being touched with your games process or code. If you have any questions about this or other bot related questions, free to ask.

<p></p>
<b>Fishing Bot:</b> Based on my recent minecraft fishing bot I publicly released. This will Auto-Fish 100% by it's self for you. It listens into the Terraria process handle and waits for a fish to "Bite" the line before pulling it in. When it does, It will recast, Repeat, Exc. This has been 100% re-coded and revamped to be the most user friendly. This also has a functional timer for your youtubers!

<b>Unlimited Lines Bot:</b> Based on my already released Fishing Glitch Utilizer. Allows you to throw unlimited lines at Ludicrous speeds. This was Re-coded and Changed Languages to bring the best experience! Using Terraria's process data, It gathers game coordinates and alongside a algorithm, auto picks your item slots, exc. No more having to manually locate stuff!

<b>Bait Bot:</b> A brand new bot that allows for intensive overnight (Or In General) bait catching. Has two different modes for your choosing. Put your flower boots to use once and for all, Dryad Approved!

<b>Custom Timers:</b> For the <i>Fishing Bot</i> I added a custom timer for stopping the bot. This timer can be set up to 99 Days! Great tool for Youtubers who do 10h fishing trips! An Infinite stack mod from TmodLoader will help! The <i>Unlimited Lines Bot</i> has a custom pull function that allows you to pull the lines in after a <u>x</u> amount of throws. This gathers fish SUPER fast!

<p></p>
<details><summary>Fishing Bot:</summary>
<p></p><b>How to use:</b>
<p></p><ul>
<li>Load in your world</li>
<li>In <b>Volume</b> settings - Turn <u>Music</u> & <u>Ambient</u> sounds off.</li>
<li>Find a quite spot to fish at.</li>
<li>Have fishing rod selected, Press "Start Bot"</li>
</ul><p></p>
<b>Settings:</b>
The Sound VU Sensitivity is basically self explanatory but essentially its how loud your game has to get before pulling the rod in. I added a VU Level Capture at the bottom right. This can be used to find how loud your "Fish" is when it bites. Simply press, find highest value, add to VU Sensitivity.

<p></p><b>How to use:</b>
<p></p><ul>

<b>Settings:</b>
There us a pull lines option for if you want to pull in all the lines after <u>x</u> amount of throws. Very useful for super mass fishing. Very quick way to farm quest fish!

<details><summary>Bait Bot:</summary>
<p></p><b>How to use:</b>
<p></p><ul>

</ul><p></p>
<b>Settings:</b>
Select your desired bait catching method. The <b>Flaregun + Flowerboots</b> method is the fastest method but requires Flares. The <b>GoldenNet + Flowerboots</b> method is slower but unlimited. If using Flaregun Method, you can select a custom amount of flares to shoot on the ground.

<details><summary>üóΩMy Reason For Public ReleaseüóΩ</summary>
<p></p>
My main goal was to release it at 1.4. however; I'm afraid when 1.4 drops, They will patch the infinite fishing line glitch, And thus loosing allot of possible attraction it would otherwise have gotten. Already know people are begging me to sell, even for large amounts of money, however I decided to decline them all and release it for free, hope y'all enjoy.
